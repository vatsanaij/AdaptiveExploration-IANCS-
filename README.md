* (a) An overview of the neural control and online learning system. In this scenario, the UAV flies at a given speed toward an obstacle. When it gets close to the obstacle, the learning system will let it learn to gradually adapt its speed and brake at a safe distance from the obstacle. The proposed control and learning system is not restricted to a certain flight path. It can be used to adapt speed to the horizontal plane (x and y directions). (b) The model-free speed adaptation algorithm is based on neural control with ICO learning mechanism and online learning capability (or considered as neural proactive control, insert circle). The reflexive path is the path for generating reactive behavior while the predictive path is the path for performing online learning and generating adaptive behavior. The algorithm acts as a primitive control function for obstacle avoidance. It allows the UAV to fly autonomously (see from right to left) and proactively adapt its flying speed and brake at a safe distance before avoiding an obstacle.*

&emsp;&emsp;Animal foraging behavior is essential for survival. This complex behavior involves a combination of local search--seeking food nearby and global search--exploring large areas for new food resources. These strategies can be adaptively alternated. During exploration, animals also navigate obstacles. Several studies have been focused on developing bio-inspired exploration mechanisms for artificial agents, with Lévy flight emerging as one of the most effective methods. However, existing Lévy models rely on mathematical representations of Lévy distributions, which are difficult to directly relate to the biological neural systems of animals. From this perspective, we propose an efficient and adaptive neural exploration control system synthesized from a small recurrent neural network. This network, characterized by its synaptic weights and adaptive inputs, exhibits neural dynamics similar to the discrete-time Lorenz attractor. The network's output provides the baseline input signal for post-processing through an adaptive bias thresholding mechanism, which generates exploration commands. These commands enable adaptive exploration behaviors that incorporate both local and global search strategies.
Additionally, to ensure safe exploration in obstacle-filled environments, we integrate an adaptive neural obstacle avoidance control into the system. We assessed the performance of the proposed system in both open and closed environments using simulated and real flying robots. The resulting flight trajectories demonstrate animal-like foraging behaviors, including local and global search strategies similar to Lévy flight, along with adaptive obstacle avoidance capabilities.
